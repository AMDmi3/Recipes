[Name] Perl-Class-Accessor-Fast
[Summary] Faster, but less expandable, accessors
[Description] This is a faster but less expandable version of
Class::Accessor. Class::Accessor's generated accessors require two
method calls to accompish their task (one for the accessor, another
for get() or set()). Class::Accessor::Fast eliminates calling
set()/get() and does the access itself, resulting in a somewhat faster
accessor.
The Class::Accessor module automagically generates accessor/mutators
for your class.
