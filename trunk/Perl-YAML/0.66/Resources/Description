[Name] Perl-YAML
[Summary] Simple configuration automation
[Description] This is a somewhat object-oriented wrapper around the YAML
module which makes reading and writing configuration files simple. Handling
multiple config files (e.g. system and per-user configuration, or a gallery
app with per-directory configuration) is a snap.
