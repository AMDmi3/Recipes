[Name] Perl-Class-MethodMaker
[Summary] Perl module to create generic methods for OO Perl
[Description] This module solves the problem of having to continually write accessor methods for your objects that perform standard tasks.

The argument to 'use' is an arrayref, as pairs whose "keys" are the names of types of generic methods generated by MethodMaker and whose "values" tell method maker what methods to make.

To override any generated methods, it is sufficient to ensure that the overriding method is defined when Class::MethodMaker is called. Note that the use keyword introduces a BEGIN block, so you may need to define (or at least declare) your overriding method in a BEGIN block.
