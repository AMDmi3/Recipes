[Name] Perl-VCD-Autrius
[Summary] A system for copying resources under version control
between repositories.
[Description] vcp (and the Perl module VCP.pm) is a system for copying
resources under version control between repositories. CVS, p4 and VSS
repositories are currently supported.
vcp can filter, rearrange repositories, and alter metadata during a
transfer.  These capabilities are used to handle conversion details like
different branching models and legal character sets between various
repositories.
