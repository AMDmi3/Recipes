[Name] Perl-GTK2
[Summary] Perl bindings to the Gtk2 graphical user interface library.
[Description] Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user interface library.
This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.
