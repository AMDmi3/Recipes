[Name] Perl-Scalar-Utils
[Summary] A selection of general-utility scalar subroutines
[Description] Scalar::Util contains a selection of subroutines that
people have expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the
usage would not really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword,
and the size so small such that being individual extensions would be
wasteful.
