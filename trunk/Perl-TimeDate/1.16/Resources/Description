[Name] Perl-TimeDate
[Summary] Date formating subroutines
[Description] This distribution replaces my earlier GetDate
distribution, which was only a date parser. The date parser contained
in this distribution is far superior to the yacc based parser, and a
*lot* faster. 
The parser contained here will only parse absolute dates, if you want
a date parser that can parse relative dates then take a look at the
Time modules by David Muir on CPAN.
