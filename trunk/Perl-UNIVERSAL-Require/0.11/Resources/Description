[Name] Perl-UNIVERSAL-Require
[Summary] Load modules from a variable
[Description] This works exactly like the standard require in Perl,
except without the bareword restriction, and it does not die. Since
require() is placed in the UNIVERSAL namespace, it will work on any
module. You just have to use UNIVERSAL::require somewhere in your code. 

If you have ever had to do this... 

   eval "require $module";
   
to get around the bareword caveats on require(), this module is for
you. It creates a universal require() class method that will work with
every Perl module and it is secure. So instead of doing some arcane
eval() work, you can do this: 

   $module->require;
   
It does not save you much typing, but it will make a lot more sense
to someone who is not a ninth level Perl acolyte.
