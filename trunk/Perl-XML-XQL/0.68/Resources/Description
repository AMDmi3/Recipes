[Name] Perl-XML-XQL
[Summary] A perl module for querying XML tree structures with XQL
[Description] The XML::XQL module implements the XQL (XML Query
Language) proposal submitted to the XSL Working Group in September
1998. The spec can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html Most of the contents
related to the XQL syntax can also be found in the XML::XQL::Tutorial
that comes with this distribution. Note that XQL is not the same as
XML-QL!
XML::XQL::DOM adds methods to XML::DOM nodes to support
XQL queries on XML::DOM document structures.
