[Name] Perl-File-Temp
[Summary] Return name and handle of a temporary file safely
[Description] This module can be used to generate temporary files
(providing a filename and filehandle) or directories. Possible race
conditions are avoided and some security checks are performed (eg
making sure the sticky bit is set on world writeable temp directories).
