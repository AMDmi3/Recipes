[Name] Perl-Class-Autouse
[Summary] Run-time load a class the first time you call a method in it.
[Description] Class::Autouse allows you to specify a class the will
only load when a method of the class is called. For large classes that
might not be used during the running of a program, such as
Date::Manip, this can save you large amounts of memory, and decrease
the script load time.
