[Name] Perl-Text-Diff
[Summary] Perform diffs on files and record sets
[Description] diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU
diff utility. It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff,
but it is better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms.
It is often faster than shelling out to a system's diff executable for
small files, and generally slower on larger files.
