[Name] Perl-Log-Log4perl
[Summary] Log4j implementation for Perl
[Description] Log::Log4perl lets you remote-control and fine-tune the
logging behaviour of your system from the outside. It implements the
widely popular (Java-based) Log4j logging package in pure Perl.
Log::Log4perl is different. It allows you to control the number of
logging messages generated at three different levels:
* At a central location in your system (either in a configuration file
  or in the startup code) you specify which components (classes,
  functions) of your system should generate logs.
* You specify how detailed the logging of these components should be by
  specifying logging levels.
* You also specify which so-called appenders you want to feed your log
  messages to ("Print it to the screen and also append it to
  /tmp/my.log") and which format ("Write the date first, then the file
  name and line number, and then the log message") they should be in.
