[Name] Meanwhile
[Summary] An Open Re-Implementation of Lotus Sametime
[Description] The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the Lotus Sametime Community Client protocol.
The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core services; Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user Conferencing, Preferences Storage, Identity Resolution, and File Transfer. This extensible client interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration of future service handlers such as the user directory and whiteboard and screen-sharing.
The Meanwhile Project is neither endorsed by, nor affiliated with Lotus or IBM. It is an independent project aiming to fill a space Lotus has left vacant.
It is not within the scope of this project to provide LDAP or SIP functionality, though these technologies are often associated with the usage of Sametime.
