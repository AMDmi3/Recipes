[Name] Perl-Font-AFM
[Summary] Interface to Adobe Font Metrics files
[Description] This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of
this class are initialised from an AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) file and
allow you to obtain information about the font and the metrics of the
various glyphs in the font.
All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to
1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual
sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale
factor of font)/1000.
