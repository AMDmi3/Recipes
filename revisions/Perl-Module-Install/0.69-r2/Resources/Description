[Name] Perl-Module-Install
[Summary] Automatic install of dependencies via CPAN
[Description] It's a lot easier for most of us to cook a meal from a
recipe, rather than just throwing things into a pot until something
edible forms. So it is with programming as well. Module::Install makes
writing Perl module installers as easy as possible. Having a set of
easy to understand samples, makes it simpler yet.
