[Description] Parse::RecDescent can be used to generate recursive descent parsers. A parser is used to make meaning of an inputs (mostly given in textual form) that follow certain patterns. These patterns are described in a grammar. The grammer consists of a set of rules (called productions). When the parser reads the input, it tries to find a rule that matches and whenever it finds such a rule, it triggers an action. It then goes on to read from the input and to find matching patterns, until the input has finished.
