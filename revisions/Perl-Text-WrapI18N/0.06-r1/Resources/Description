[Name] Perl-Text-WrapI18N
[Summary] Line wrapping module with support for multibyte, fullwidth, and combining characters and languages without whitespaces between words.
[Description] This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. This module is needed to support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5. This module also supports characters with irregular widths, such as combining characters (which occupy zero columns on terminal, like diacritical marks in UTF-8) and fullwidth characters (which occupy two columns on terminal, like most of east Asian characters). Also, minimal handling of languages which doesn't use whitespaces between words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported.

Like Text::Wrap, hyphenation and "kinsoku" processing are not supported, to keep simplicity.

wrap(firstheader, nextheader, texts) is the main subroutine of Text::WrapI18N module to execute the line wrapping. Input parameters and output data emulate Text::Wrap. The texts have to be written in locale encoding.
