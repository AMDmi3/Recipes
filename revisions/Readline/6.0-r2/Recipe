#This seems to be the minimal solution to the default libreadline.so
#not listing all libraries it needs.  Without this, newer Parted
#breaks and apparently uClibc too.  See INSTALL in the source directory
#for details and the Readline maintainers' rationale for their troublesome
#default.
#libtinfo (terminfo) is part of Ncurses, so Ncurses goes in Dependencies.
#Indeed, it was most likely a runtime dependency already.
#For my (Isaac's) thread of analyzing this problem, see:
