[Name] Perl-ExtUtils-ParseXS
[Summary] Convert Perl XS code into C code
[Description] ExtUtils::ParseXS will compile XS code into C code by
embedding the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl
values, and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those
functions. 
This is all the same functionality as the "xsubpp" program included
with perl -- and in fact there's an "xsubpp" replacement script
included in this package -- but this package's modular interface may
be more convenient for some purposes.
