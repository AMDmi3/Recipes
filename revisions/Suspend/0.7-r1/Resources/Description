[Name] Suspend
[Summary] Tools for suspending the system to RAM and to disk.
[Description] The goal of the project is to create a tool that can \
handle the so called "suspend-to-both". Suspend to both means that \
prior putting the system in STR (suspend to ram) a snapshot of the \
running system is taken and stored on disk (as suspend to disk); if \
for any reason (e.g. battery depleted) the state store in the RAM is \
lost the user can resume from the disk without losing data.
