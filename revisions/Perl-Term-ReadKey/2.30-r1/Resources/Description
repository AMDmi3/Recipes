[Name] Perl-Term-ReadKey
[Summary] A perl module for simple terminal control
[Description] Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to
providing simple control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw,
cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking reads, if the architecture
allows, and some generalized handy functions for working with
terminals. One of the main goals is to have the functions as portable
as possible, so you can just plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on any
architecture and have a good likelyhood of it working.
