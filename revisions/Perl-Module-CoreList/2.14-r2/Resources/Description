[Name] Perl-Module-CoreList
[Summary] What modules shipped with versions of perl
[Description] Module::CoreList contains the hash of hashes
%Module::CoreList::version, this is keyed on perl version as indicated
in $]. The second level hash is module => version pairs. 
Note, it is possible for the version of a module to be unspecified,
whereby the value is undef, so use exists $version{$foo}{$bar} if
that's what you're testing for. 
It also contains %Module::CoreList::released hash, which has ISO
formatted versions of the release dates, as gleaned from perlhist.
