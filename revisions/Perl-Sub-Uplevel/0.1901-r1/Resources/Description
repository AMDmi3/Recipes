[Name] Perl-Sub-Uplevel
[Summary] Safe call stack spoofing for perl
[Description] Sub::Uplevel from CPAN provides a safe implementation
similar to Tcl's uplevel() function. It allows you to safely fool the
caller() into thinking it's in a different part of the stack, without
knowing that it is being wrapped.
