[Name] Perl-File-Chdir
[Summary] A more sensible way to change directories
[Description] Perl's chdir() has the unfortunate problem of being
very, very, very global. If any part of your program calls chdir() or
if any library you use calls chdir(), it changes the current working
directory for the whole program.
